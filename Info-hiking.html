<h1><center> Info About Hiking </center></h1>

<p>
	Hiking is the preferred term, in Canada and the United States, for a long,
	vigorous walk, usually on trails, in the countryside, while the word
	walking is used for shorter, particularly urban walks. In the United
	Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, the word "walking" is acceptable to
	describe all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or
	backpacking. The term bushwalking is endemic to Australia, having been adopted by the
	Sydney Bush Walkers club in 1927. In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or
	hike is called tramping. It is a popular activity with numerous hiking
	organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking have
	health benefits (Wikipedia)

	<b>Benefits of Hiking </b
	<br/>
	<br/>
</p>
<p>
	Hiking is one of the healthiest activities. In addition to getting a fresh
	air and an exercise, hiking is a powerful cardio workout that can:

	<li>
		Lower your risk of heart disease
	</li>
	<li>
		Improves your blood pressure and heart rate.
	</li>
	<li>

	</li>
	<li>
		Improve balance
	</li>
	<li>
		Help control your weight
	</li>
	<li>
		Boost your mood. "Research shows that hiking has a positive impact on
		combating the symptoms of stress and anxiety," says Gregory A. Miller,
		PhD, president of the American Hiking Society. "Being in nature is
		ingrained in our DNA, and we sometimes forget that."

	<strong>Six Reasons Why You Should Spend Outdoors Hiking:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1. Fresh air is good for your digestive system</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Fresh air increases the flow of oxygen helping you digest food more
	effectively so this will particularly help if you are trying to lose
	weight.
	<br/>
	<br/>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2. Fresh air helps improve blood pressure and heart rate</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Avoid polluted environments particularly if you need to improve your blood
	pressure. Stay away from the busy traffic as the body will need to work
	harder to get the amount of oxygen it needs over polluted car fumes.
	<br/>
	<br/>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3. Fresh air makes you happier</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The more fresh air you get, the more oxygen you will breathe which will
	increase the amount of serotonin (the happy hormone) you inhale,
	consequently making you happier.
	<br/>
	<br/>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>4. Fresh air strengthens your immune system</strong>
</p>
<p>
	By increasing the amount of fresh air we get, will increase the amount of
	oxygen which helps our white blood cells function properly by fighting and
	killing bacteria and germs.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>5. Fresh air cleans your lungs</strong>
</p>
<p>
	You lungs dilate more from having an increase of oxygen so fresh air
	improves the cleansing of your lungs. You release airborne toxins from your
	body when exhaling through your lungs.
	<br/>
	<br/>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6. Fresh air gives you more energy and a sharper mind</strong>
</p>
<p>
	You may have noticed after spending time outside, you come back indoors
	feeling brighter and perhaps ready to get back to work. More oxygen results
	in greater brain functioning, improving your concentration skills and
	providing you with more energy.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, venturing outside will also help you produce vitamin D from
	the sun (when it does come out), which is essential for many bodily
	functions including supporting our immune system, strengthening our bones,
	teeth and much more.
